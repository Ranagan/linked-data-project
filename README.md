# linked-data-project


## Datasets used

Dataset 1: Permanent private households by year built.

Dataset 2: Number of households with internet

## Current Plan

This API will hopefully use node to connect to a NEO4j graph database and query the two datasets. I have included the two datasets and will be updating this project periodically.
